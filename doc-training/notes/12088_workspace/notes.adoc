* Where are the files?
* Is there a copy on the local machine?
* Do you "edit in place"?

"Workspace" is an overloaded term.  Spend some time asking what each person
thinks of when they here 'workspace'.

Take a tour of the file system of the repository on a Windows machine.

* See the .project files.
* See the models and gen folders.

From Windows, navigate to the repository ("across the network") on my Mac.

* Create a new workspace and Import Existing Projects 'einstein', 'Pub', 'wx'.

What do you think we will find inside the workspace folder?

From Windows, navigate to the workspace folder and see what is inside.
