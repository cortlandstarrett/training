= Focused Model Compiler Training

xtUML Project Analysis Note

== 1 Abstract

A user wishes to receive 8 hours of training focused on model compilation
and model-based model compilation in particular.  This note documents the
plans and establishes references to the materials employed.

== 2 Introduction and Background

Model compilation and building model compilers is a mature science.  However,
in recent years best practices have changed.  There is progress toward
generalizing model compiler construction as a mostly normal xtUML application.
There are 2 distinctives of model-based model compilers.  1) They must be
able to load instances of an xtUML application.  This means they can read
and operation upon instances of the xtUML metamodel (OOA of OOA).  2) They
also must be able to emit text through a template mechanism.

== 3 Requirements

=== 3.1 Fundamentals of Model Compilers
Review the fundamentals of traditional model compilers.

=== 3.2 Model-Based Model Compilers
Elucidate model-based model compilers.

=== 3.3 MC-Boj
Review the artifacts of the jump start of MC-Boj in light of the above.

== 4 Work Required

. Deliver this document via email.
. Provide folder on USB stick.

. How model compilers work.
  .. Use the SM Runtime Presentation 4-7, 21-23 <<dr-5>>.
  .. The Traditional Way
     ... Use the MCtranslation presentation from <<dr-3>>.
  .. Transitioning from Traditional to Model-Based
     ... Use the Way Forward presentation from the folder.
  .. Model-based model compilers
     ... Use the itida presentation from the folder.


. Examples
  .. Docgen
     ... OOA of OOA (mcooa)
     ... instance loader
     ... target model (document)
     ... model to model transformations

  .. MC-Boj
     ... OOA of OOA (mcooa)
     ... instance loader (built-in to Ciera)
     ... target model (Ada)
     ... model to model transformations (transformations folder)
     ... templates
     ... project separation

. Exercises
  .. Build MC-Boj.
  .. Change a template and see the effect.
  .. Change the model and see the effect.

. Model-Based Model Compilers
  .. Walk through _MBMC_ outline in folder.
  .. Walk through _Internals_ outline in folder.

. Modeling Idioms
  .. Workspace rules
  .. Projects
     ... Inter-Project References
     ... types, EEs
  .. Package and Package References
